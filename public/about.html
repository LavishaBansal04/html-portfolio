<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone!As you already know my name is Lavisha Bansal and I'm a first year student who loves coding and started her coding journey 
  late but very committed.If you have come till here then i am really grateful that you invested your time in reviewing my project. It's a
   very basic and my very first project on HTML that I've posted. I'm a beginner in Web Development and eager to learn moere. Ofcourse I've 
   got big goals and miles to cover in this field and I'll surely do as someone rightly said "Better late than never." I'll upgrade this project
    after learning more new tools and will make this a lot better rather than looking like a 90's website.
</p>
<p>SO yaaa I'll definetely post a new project and update you guys soon, till then STAY TUNED!</p>
